# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Graciliano and my nickname is Neto!

- I am currently interning at the Department of Culture in my state, where I am part of the development team. I am contributing to the creation and improvement of a system that centralizes and facilitates access to public policies for artists and cultural agents.

- I am currently learning all about programming, focusing my studies on web development. After acquiring this knowledge, I intend to focus my attention on mobile development, an area that I have great appreciation for due to the experiences I acquired during college.
